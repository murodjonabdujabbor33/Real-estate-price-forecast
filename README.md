# Welcome Real-estate-price-forecast
***

In this project, I will build a model to predict the price base based on predefined criteria.

## Task
Housing prices are a hot topic today. In this project, I am asked to create a model to predict the price base based on predefined criteria.
We have a collection of housing prices in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
This project is divided into 2 parts:
  1) Understanding the data.
  2) Create a linear regression prediction model.

## Description
I worked on this assignment in 5 steps:
1) Load Dataset. At this stage, I explored the data.
2) Visualization
3) Looking for correlations
4) Machine Learning
5) Prediction

## Installation
To run the project, the %pip install and %pip install seaborn sklearn commands must be executed in the jupyter notebook.
The project requires the use of the sklearn, numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib libraries,
as well as the LinearRegression and train_test_split classes from sklearn. To view the absolute errors, you need the mean_square error and root_mean_square_error classes.

## Usage
A Jupyter notebook is used to implement the project.
the required package libraries and packages are installed. Then the functions are launched.
Available funtions:
